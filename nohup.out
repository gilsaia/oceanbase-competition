Reading /proc/26714/task/26714/maps time out. You may want to increase the time limit by --proc-map-timeout
[ perf record: Woken up 197 times to write data ]
Warning:
1 map information files for pre-existing threads were
not processed, if there are samples for addresses they
will not be resolved, you may find out which are these
threads by running with -v and redirecting the output
to a file.
The time limit to process proc map is too short?
Increase it by --proc-map-timeout
